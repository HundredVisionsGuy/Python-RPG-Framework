## Credits/Resources
* [Base character class attributes](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/game-development/9781788623469/3/ch03lvl1sec24/base-character-class-attributes) - this is a Java tutorial, but served as a basis for base character classes
* [Java Sample Assignment - Text Adventure Game](https://www.codersarts.com/post/java-sample-project-1-text-adventure-game) - another Java project idea, but in Java
* [Attribute (role-playing games)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(role-playing_games)#:~:text=An%20attribute%20is%20a%20piece,cases%2C%20a%20set%20of%20dice.) - where I got my character class attribute definitions
